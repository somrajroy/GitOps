# Understanding GitOps :  Faster, More Efficient Software Development &amp; Streamlining DevOps Workflows<br/>
## Introduction
GitOps is a relatively new approach to software development that combines Git, the popular version control system, with the automation of DevOps. It emphasizes the use of Git as a single source of truth for both infrastructure and application code, allowing teams to manage their entire development lifecycle from within Git. In this short blog post, we will explore what GitOps is all about, its key principles, benefits, and how customers can implement it in their organization. <br/>

In Cloud native software development, efficiency and agility are paramount. Traditional methods of software deployment and management often lead to bottlenecks, delays, and inconsistencies. This is where GitOps comes into play. It is a set of practices and principles that utilize version control systems, such as Git, to manage and automate the deployment and operation of applications and infrastructure. GitOps is a modern approach to software delivery and operations that harnesses the power of version control systems, such as Git, to streamline the development and deployment process. GitOps treats infrastructure as code and uses Git as a single source of truth for managing both application code and infrastructure configurations. This means that instead of using separate tools for managing infrastructure and application code, teams can use Git to manage everything from code changes to infrastructure deployments. By doing so, GitOps enables organizations to streamline their development process, improve collaboration between teams, and reduce errors caused by manual processes.<br/>

The guiding principles of GitOps are simple to articulate: A single source of the truth shall be maintained in the Git repository. Automation will be used to apply any changes committed to the Git repository. Any manual changes to an environment will be reverted automatically.In this blog, we will delve into the concept of GitOps, its benefits, and how it is transforming the way organizations manage their software & infrastructure.<br/>
## Principles of GitOps
The core tenets of GitOps focus on declarative configuration, versioning, collaboration, and automation. It brings together development and operations teams, fostering a unified and efficient approach to continuous delivery. The key principles of GitOps include: <br/><br/>
** Infrastructure as Code (IaC): Infrastructure is defined and managed using tools like Terraform, Helm charts, or YAML manifests. These files declaratively state the desired state, making it machine-readable and repeatable.<br/>
** Version Control as the Single Source of Truth : The Git repository serves as the sole source of truth for infrastructure configuration & application code. First, this ensures consistency across environments and facilitates collaboration among teams.  Secondly, this ensures visibility, traceability, and the ability to roll back to previous states if needed. <br/>
** Declarative infrastructure : GitOps relies on declarative specifications to define the desired state of both the infrastructure and application components which are stored in Git.  This allows for versioning, collaboration, and easy rollback of infrastructure changes. <br/>
** Automation & Automated Synchronization/Deployments : GitOps workflows include automated processes that continuously synchronize the desired state described in Git with the actual state of the deployed infrastructure. This automation ensures that the system converges towards the declared state & liminates manual processes and reduces human error.<br/>
** Continuous Delivery, integration, deployment and Rollback : GitOps automates the deployment process by integrating CI/CD pipelines with Git workflows. When changes are made to the Git repository, the CI/CD pipeline automatically deploys the changes to the target environment, ensuring consistency and reliability. changes are continuously built, tested, and deployed to production. <br/>
** Observability and Auditing : Observability, which refers to any system that can be observed, is an important concept in GitOps. Observability in GitOps lets customers ensure that the desired state and the observed state (or actual state) are the same. GitOps promotes observability by providing a clear view into changes made to the system over time. Auditing capabilities are inherent in the Git version control system, enabling teams to track who made changes, when, and what those changes were. Any deviations or drifts from the desired state are automatically detected and corrected, maintaining the system's integrity.<br/>
** Collaboration: GitOps encourages collaboration between teams, including developers, operations, and quality assurance, to work together on the same codebase. Collaboration is facilitated through pull requests and code reviews within Git. Changes to the system undergo a review process before being merged into the main branch, ensuring that alterations meet quality standards and align with the overall architecture.<br/>
